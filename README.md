# Simulation-of-Internet-Model
The TCP/IP is a protocol suite (a set of protocols organized in different layers) that
is used on the Internet today.
This project helps the user understand the working of the internet model with the
help of a simple simulation.
I have designed the TCP/IP model in C++ language using the graphics.h library.
I have created two LANs each consisting of three computers. The computers in each LAN
are connected in a bus topology.
The project then takes user input to decide the source and destination computers for
communication.
If the computers belong from the same LAN then we do not need a router for the
communication to take place.
For communicating between two LANs the message passes from the router.
